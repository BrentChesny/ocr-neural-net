## OCR Neural Network

Simple neural network that can be used to recognize handwritten digits. The network uses gradient descent with backpropagation as a training algorithm. The MNIST dataset is used to train it. The current network achieves an accuracy of over 95%.

### Build instructions

The project be easily built using CMake:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Running the project is as easy as running:

```bash
./ocr_neural_net
```
